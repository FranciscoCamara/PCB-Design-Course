# PCB Design Course

A repository containing course material, projects, and examples for learning printed circuit board (PCB) design using KiCad.

## About

This repository hosts all the materials for the **PCB Design Course** taught by Profesor Cândido Duarte. It is intended for students who want to learn the fundamentals of PCB design, from schematic capture to board layout, fabrication files, and assembly.

## Course Structure

The course is organized into projects. Each project builds on the previous one.

```text
PCB-Design-Course/
├── Projeto1/          ← First project (simple design, single layer, etc.)
├── Projeto2/          ← More advanced design (multi-layer, components, etc.)
└── README.md
```

## Projects

### Projeto1

* Description: introductory project
